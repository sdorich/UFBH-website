            <h1>Our Mission Statement</h1>
            <p>
            Utah Friends of Basset Hounds, Inc., a federally recognized 501(c)(3) public charity, is a basset hound rescue group who provides veterinary care, food, shelter and support to basset hounds needing assistance in Utah. We treat these animals with care and respect. UFBH makes decisions based on compassion and with concern for the quality of life of each individual basset hound. We place basset hounds in our care into foster homes and permanent homes with consideration to personality, behavior, and special needs. We provide continuing support to adoptive families throughout the lifetime of the dogs.
            </p>
            <p>
            We work in direct cooperation with all local and state shelters to reduce euthanasia of basset hounds. Of the bassets we rescue and care for, approximately 40% come from these shelters. The other 60% of our bassets are surrendered by their current owners directly into UFBH care. By taking in bassets surrendered by their owners, UFBH helps ease the burden on our local animal shelters by preventing those bassets from ever entering the animal shelter system.
            </p>
