            <h1>Fostering</h1>
            <p>One of the most critical volunteer positions for any rescue is the foster home. Foster families provide a temporary home and evaluate the basset's personality and behavior around other dogs and pets, adults, and children. By observing and reporting on the basset's personality, attitude and temperament, the foster home is able to help our Adoption Coordinator match the hound to the best adoptive family. Foster homes also help the basset hound to make a smooth transition to their forever home.</p>

                    There is always URGENT need for foster home volunteers.

                    Foster families help us save on boarding costs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We do require that a foster home be in the general proximity of Salt Lake so the basset is accessible to potential adoptive families.

                    If you would like to be an Old Hound's Home, the area in which we will place a basset is more extensive.

                    Some of the hounds UFBH rescues are older and the probability of their being adopted is not very good. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our senior hounds simply want food, a little peace and quiet, and a soft place to take long naps. We would like to place these bassets in &ldquo;Old Hound Homes&rdquo;&mdash;permanent foster families who will give them loving care and keep them safe until they leave for the Rainbow Bridge.
                </li>
                <li>
                    UFBH realizes the challenges that come with adopting an older dog, including more frequent vet visits and increased costs. To that end, UFBH will pay for their vet care and help with food, or other expenses, if necessary. UFBH volunteers will also help with nail trims, vet transport, baths&ndash;virtually anything that helps keep them with a loving family.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We are hoping to match some of these senior hounds with senior or retired people, who don&rsquo;t feel they can afford the cost of owning a dog, but would love the companionship.
