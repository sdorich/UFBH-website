                    Foster a Basset&mdash;Foster homes are one of the most critical volunteer positions for any rescue. Foster families provide a temporary home and evaluate the basset's personality and behavior around other dogs and pets, adults, and children. By observing and reporting on the basset's personality, attitude, and temperament, the foster home is able to help our Adoption Coordinator match the hound to the best adoptive family. Foster homes also help the basset hound to make a smooth transition to their forever home.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transportation and Home Checks&mdash;Often, UFBH needs help getting basset hounds from the shelters to the foster home, or from the foster home to vet appointments. Most folks involved in our cause are volunteers who have full time jobs. This makes transportation a challenge. Moreover, because most of our active members live along the Wasatch Front and our coverage area includes the entire state, we are always looking for people to help us with home checks in those areas that are farther away.
                </li>
